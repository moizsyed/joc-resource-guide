<h1>The Journalists of Color Resource Guide</h1>
<h3>A compilation of resources for journalists looking to level up their career and the newsrooms they work in</h3>


    <div class="content">There’s the call you are on to get your friend to ask for that higher salary, that feels so uncomfortable to even imagine. There’s the lunch you have to strategize how you can get your manager to make diversity a must-have, not just a nice-to-have. There’s the pitch about a story that affects mostly minorities that you review for a friend so they can get their editor to care.

This is the kind of work that informal networks of journalists of color do for one another. This is the kind of invisible labor done in the background that a lot of underrepresented groups in newsrooms do to improve both their newsrooms and the careers of their peers.

The results are real — that woman of color whose friend told her to ask for more money got a raise and her salary may close up the pay gap at her organization just a tiny bit. A hire who heard about a job from another friend may get hired and adds a new voice to the canon of a news organization. Managers likely learn from their employees’ extensive research.

These are all good things that improve our newsrooms.

But this kind of labor can take a lot out of us. We pass on information person-to-person in a fashion that sometimes can feel like an elaborate game of telephone. This resource is meant to make things a little easier for journalists of color seeking help to further their careers or to make their organizations better.
