There’s the call you are on to get your friend to ask for that higher salary, that feels so uncomfortable to even imagine. There’s the lunch you have to strategize how you can get your manager to make diversity a must-have, not just a nice-to-have. There’s the pitch about a story that affects mostly minorities that you review for a friend so they can get their editor to care.

This is the kind of work that informal networks of journalists of color do for one another. This is the kind of invisible labor done in the background that a lot of underrepresented groups in newsrooms do to improve both their newsrooms and the careers of their peers. 

The results are real — that woman of color whose friend told her to ask for more money got a raise and her salary may close up the pay gap at her organization just a tiny bit. A hire who heard about a job from another friend may get hired and adds a new voice to the canon of a news organization. Managers likely learn from their employees’ extensive research. 

These are all good things that improve our newsrooms and our industry. But this kind of labor can take a lot out of us. We pass on information person-to-person in a fashion that sometimes can feel like an elaborate game of telephone. This resource is meant to make things a little easier for journalists of color seeking help to further their careers or to make their organizations better. 


# Background
The reason why we made this resource is to because we repeatedly observed the same needs in our various circles of journalists of color. Every few weeks or every couple of months, people posed the same questions in slack rooms, in classrooms,  in closed meetings or on social media. Each time, we would cobble these resources together based on these requests. This resource is a way for us to address these needs in a more efficient way beyond our personal pipelines. 
 
To get a more holistic grasp of the needs of journalists of color we constructed a simple survey. More than 260 people participated in the survey. The majority of respondents identified as Asian (44.1%), followed by Black or African American (22.3%), two races or more (14.6%), White (8.5%), Arab or Middle Easter (2.83%), Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders (2.4%) and Other (5.26%). Close to a quarter of our respondents (23.7%) identified as Hispanic or Latinx and respondents skewed younger, with more than three quarters (75.3%) were 34 years of age or younger. 
 
Participants were able to evaluate four main topics (salary data, demographics data, career growth and structural work) and also write up comments about their biggest concerns. Based on both the evaluations and the comments, we found that journalists of color needed resources related to these four topics (in order of importance): 
 
1. Salary–and benefits–related issues
2. Information that could help them hold their institutions accountable 
3. Career-furthering materials and mentorship programs
4. Information about courses and workshops that can help them acquire more skills
 
These resources exist because institutions across the country are failing to address systemic issues. We hope that this is only one of many solutions to building more diverse newsrooms and encourage institutions across the country to find other ways to empower journalists of color in their newsrooms.
